# How i played with gamma-AdjustedNN

## TO DO
- [x] trying to implement from scratch dataset construction task (load_simple_dataset.py)
- [x] discovering the Remi Viola code and workflow
- [x] testing it on simple case : Testingworkflow
- [x] merging their and customized it (models_perso.py/testing_workflow.py)
- [x] describing dataset : Describe_dataset notebook
- [x] test on toy dataset
- [x] test on all dataset with OS
- [ ] test on all dataset with metric learning

## Comparison with methods

- decision trees ?
- logistic reg
- svm
- naive bayes
- 

## Workcomments
- how they played with categorial data ? how to play with binarised data ?

## Hitch
- Yeast dataset
- gradient based library pb

## Fist install requirements

```console
C:/User/directory/AdjustedNearestNeigborAlgo/scripts> pip install -r requirements.txt
```
